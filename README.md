# Coordinate-Geometry-And-Vector-Algebra-x86-Assembly-

The project will run on visual studio after complete set up for x86 Assembly .This projects was comprised of two sections:

1) COORDINATE GEOMETRY :-

Functions that are capable of handling all calculations related to coordinate axes ,area, length, volume of 2D and 3D shapes 

2) VECTOR ALGEBRA :-

All vector related operations including dot product cross product ,linear combination of vectors and many more.

Generating both integer as well as floating point notation of outputs with user friendly interface .The main technique of FPU registers was used
